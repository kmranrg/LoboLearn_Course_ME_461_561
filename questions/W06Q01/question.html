  <h4>Selecting the Better Sensor Pair for a Drone Prototype</h4>

  <p>
    Your team is building a lightweight drone with two on-board sensors that
    measure <em>fluctuating cross-wind</em> and <em>vertical up-draft</em>.
    Ideally, these two readings should be <strong>as independent as
    possible</strong> so that the flight controller can treat them separately.
  </p>

  <p>
    During wind-tunnel tests you try <em>two different sensor placements</em>.
    Each placement produces 1000 sample pairs \((Y_1,Y_2)\).  
    The results are shown below as two scatter plots.

  </p>

  <p>
    A lower off-diagonal covariance (i.e.&nbsp;weaker linear correlation)
    means <strong>better independence</strong>.

  <p class="mt-2">
    Which plot corresponds to the placement with the <em>smaller</em>
    covariance?
